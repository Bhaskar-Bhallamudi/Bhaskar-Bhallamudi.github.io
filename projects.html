For this classification problem we can test models like Decision Tree,Logistic Regression, kNN etc., and then select the Best Model based on Evaluation metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, F1 Score etc.   <a class="project-link" href="https://github.com/Bhallamudi-Bhaskar/Online_Payment_Fraud_Detection">View here</a></p>

				<div class="text-box">
					<p class="text-box">Problem Statement -- "Detecting and Recognizing a traffic sign ".</p>
					<p class="text-box">In order to build this, there are 2 phases which are Phase 1: Detect the traffic sign Phase 2: Recognize the sign. For this I built a CNN model with the architecture of 2 Convolution layers and a Maxpool layer then a Dense Fully Connected Layer and finally a Dense Layer. The activation functions which I used are 'ReLu' and "Softmax" for Convolution and Dense layers respectively. Then after training the CNN model, we Test the model using various evaluation metrics such as Accuracy Score , Precision etc. Also the Loss function used here is 'Categorical Crossentropy' since its Classification problem with more than 2 classes .  <a class="project-link" href="https://github.com/Bhallamudi-Bhaskar/Traffic_Sign_Recognition">View here</a></p>

					<p class="text-box">Problem Statement -- "Developing a model which recognizes Hate Speech from Twitter's Tweets to help make the platform more safe for everyone" </p>
					<p class="text-box">This is part of Sentiment Analysis. We have to detect hate speech in people's tweets so that the platform is a healty space. Ofcourse, we have to start with Text Preprocessing as it's text data i.e., Removing Puncutations and Stop words etc. After that I have performed Tokenizing the data. Converting the words into Vectors. Now, for the Neural Network Model, the architecture I have used is 2 Embedding layers, LSTM layer, 1 FC layer, BatchNormalization layer, Dropout Layer, Output Layer. The Output layer outputs probablities for the 3 classes (0- Hate Speech, 1- Offensive Language, 2- Neither). The optimizer I have used in this is 'Adam', Activation Function is 'Softmax", and Loss function is "Categorical Crossentropy" and finally Evaluation Metrics used is "Accuracy"<a class="project-link" href="https://github.com/Bhaskar-Bhallamudi/Hate_Speech_Detection">View here</a></p>

					<p class="text-box">As we know the video games have many genres/categories, first thing I did was performing EDA on the dataset after cleaning it. This helps us to understand the dataset a bit more. Since this is regression problem , I have used models like Linear Regression, Decision Tree, k-NN etc and selected the best performance model based on regression metrics like MSE, MAE.  </p>
